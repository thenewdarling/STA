**Lt. Elandra Val** is the Flight Control Officer aboard the USS [[Curiosity]]. She is a Trill, and the current host to the Val symbiont.

Elandra grew up on a starbase for cargo transportation, and gained an early love of space flight. She was sent back to Trill for 'bad behaviour', after a particularly bad incident where she essentially nicked an escape pod and did space donuts in it.

After being sent home, she gained some respect and learned to slow down a bit, and applied several times to be Joined before being picked out by Jarzeg specifically for her flight abilities. They get to know each other shortly, and when he died she took over his place in Starfleet, gaining honorary commendations by dint of having the memories of two ranked Starfleet officers.  

Elandra is the fourth host of the Val symbiont.

## Previous hosts

#### Lieutenant Commander Jarzeg Val

A talented but overly-stuffy pilot that was the Dad Friend of the bridge crew on his crew. He was a kind of burly rotund guy who didn't really talk about his feelings. He got on with [[Bakral]] when they were on his previous command together.

He died of a heart-attack, it was implied due to stress. Elandra also says he didn't seek help for his health conditions until they were too late, ascribing it to his gender.

#### Unnamed Second Host

#### Unnamed First Host

One of the first two hosts also were Starfleet officers.
