**Cd. Vyroc** is the Chief Security Officer aboard the USS [[Curiosity]], and following their first day on board, he was promoted to First Officer after their initial placement turned out to be a Cardassian spy. They have dual Vulcan and human ethnicities.

They were raised in a Starfleet family, entiely around humans, nearby to the Academy. As a result, they valorise Starfleet, and know little of their Vulcan heritage.

They are 5'3" and just a tiny angry little guy.
