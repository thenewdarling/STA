**Cd. Vyroc** is the Chief Security Officer aboard the USS [[Curiosity]], and the third in command behind the First Officer, [[Unnamed First Officer]]. They have dual Vulcan and human ethnicities.

They were raised in a Starfleet family, entiely around humans, nearby to the Academy. As a result, they valorise Starfleet, and know little of their Vulcan heritage.

They are 5'3" and just a tiny angry little guy.
