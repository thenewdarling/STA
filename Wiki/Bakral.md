**Captain Evoixi Bakral** is the Captain of the USS [[Discovery]]. He is Betazoid.

This is his second command following the destruction of his first ship, the USS (didn't write it down, sounded French) in the Dominion War. Prior to his Captaincy he was a ship counsellor. His experiences in the Dominion War have traumatised him somewhat.

His signature drink is the affogato.
