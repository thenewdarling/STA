## Stardate 54012.4

- The crew have arrived at *Deep Space Nine* and are due to leave for their mission to the Gamma Quadrant.
- On the morning of their departure, the crew awaken to find that the ship is in full quarantine. Lt. [[Jahelb]] is able to bypass the locks on the doors, and they make their way to the Bridge through the Jefferies tubes.
- After regaining minor control of the ship, [[Carlton]] reasserts control, revealing himself to be a Cardassian spy with a grudge against Cpt. [[Bakral]] for the outcome of the *Battle of [[Denobula IV]]*.
- [[Carlton]] is neutralised, and beamed to the brig for interrogation.
- The crew hail the government on Cardassia Prime and get a likely suspect based on the information to hand -- [[Dul Nalok]].
- After a rather unsettling intimidation (nine successes), [[Dul Nalok]] reveals his identity and his rather pathetic plan.
- The ship returns to DS9. [[Vyroc]] is promoted to First Officer following [[Carlton]]'s absence.
