**Captain Evoixi Bakral** is the Captain of the USS [[Discovery]]. He is Betazoid.

This is his second command following the destruction of his first ship, the USS Laveau in the Dominion War. Prior to his Captaincy he was a ship counsellor. His experiences in the Dominion War have traumatised him somewhat.

At least one of these battles was the Battle of [[Denobula IV]].

His signature drink is the affogato. He is famous for off-loading most menial tasks to Ensigns, to the point where Ensigns can usually get promotions immediately after completing service on his ship.
