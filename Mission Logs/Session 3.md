## Stardate 54080.6

### GM's Log

The Curiosity has begun the first phase of its mission in the Gamma Quadrant, following a loosely spiraling pattern. Away from the wormhole, collecting long term sensor probes left near points of interest. The science labs have been busy but the same can't be said for the other departments. 

You are still within relatively easy comms range with the other ships assigned to this mission and the Alpha Quadrant as well thanks to the comms array near the wormhole.

Commander [[Vyroc]] has taken some ensigns out to collect the last few probes in a star system nearby, and soon you will be heading truly into the unknown.

### Events

- The [[Curiosity]] receives a distress call from the *USS Tokuno*, a Norway-class science vessel.
- The Captain, a Tellarite named *Voorn* reports an anomaly and is suffering power loss to engines. They still have life support and replicators but warp and impulse are down. He seems to be suffering from a bad headache, and reports that it is affecting anyone who is not engaging with recreational activity.
- "So the idea you're going with is 'drugs'".
- Dr [[Vaanik]] and Captain [[Bakral]] attempt to make a psychotropic drug to try and counteract the effects.
- After taking an overly strong dose, the Captain trips. For the rest of the session he sees visions of a koala.
- The [[Curiosity]] reaches the anomaly and the crew interact with the *Vibes Alien*, a nebulous gas cloud that wants to observe people relaxing. [[Vaanik]] plays kal-toh with it.
- The [[Curiosity]] attempts to tow the Tokuno out of the anomaly, but an asteroid banks off it and rips a hole in the Tokuno's hull. We manage to emergency beam-out the staff because everyone onboard is unconscious by this point.
- [[Curiosity]] leaves safely and returns to its mission.
