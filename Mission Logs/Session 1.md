## Stardate 54003.9

- The soon-to-be crew of the USS [[Curiosity]] are currently aboard the runabout vessel the USS [[White Cart]], en route to *Deep Space Nine* where the ship is waiting for their new placement. Our mission will be to be part of the second wave of ships exploring the Gamma Quadrant in the aftermath of the Dominion War. 
- The crew receive a looped distress call from [[Xerxes IV]], a class-M planet uninhabited but for a Federation science crew who were conducting research on the surface.
- After landing the ship through an ion storm that appears to be worsening, the ship's transporters, main power, and thrusters are damaged. The crew are then beset by neanderthal humans who appear to wear the tattered remains of the Starfleet crew's uniforms.
- After deterring the attacking neanderthals, who seem highly confused and panicking, we push through the underbrush towards the research station. It is intact, but phaser burns are evident and it looks like it's been turned upside-down.
- We meet Dr [[Heidi Ship]], one of the last members of the original expedition. She also seems to be turning into a neanderthal. She and the crew, including her partner, [[Joseph Conrad]], were here studying unique plants, and had just made a breakthrough in curing *Irumodic Syndrome*, a rare disease. She is insistent we save the research.
- She explains that the ion storm started devolving animals first, before turning on the crew. Some people turned immediately, some took days.
- Dr [[Vaanik]] manages to synthesize a cure for the devolution problem while Cd. [[Vyroc]], Capt. [[Bakral]] and Lt. [[Jahelb]] venture outside to investigate the plants and also round up the affected researchers so they can be cured and/or transported back to the runabout. Lt. [[Val]] starts sourcing resources in the science station to fix the runabout's broken systems.
- After succeeding in their tasks, the affected researchers start to break into the science station. Combat breaks out, and the ion storm is getting closer...
